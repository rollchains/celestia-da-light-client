# Celestia DA Light Client

This module is a simple light client for Celestia DA inclusion verification. It tracks the Celstia chain and can verify share/blob membership via their proofs. It was originally built for and embedded within the Tiablob module, but can be used for other applications. It does not currently have ibc-go dependencies.
